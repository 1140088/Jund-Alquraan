this repository clarifies the concept of class, interface, polymorphism, data coupling, and stamp coupling.
the class student and teacher are an example of inheritance from the parent class Person.
the class student and teacher implement the base interface so it should override all methods of that interface or declare it as abstract methods.
toDo() method is a method that implemented in different forms. this is polymorphism.
calculatGrade() and checkGrade() are coupled by the grade. the dependency between two modules based on data and that what we call data coupling.
the complete object of type teacher is passed to teacherInfo() method. this is the stamp coupling; when you pass complete data structure from one module to another.
